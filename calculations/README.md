# Instructions

The scripts take specific data types using our data. Please contact the author for the paper.

Scripts are found in `utils/excess_probabilities.py`


## Rewiring networks

`preserve_strength` - preserves strength only
`build_following_networks` - preserves strength and following
`preserve_strength_and_ocs` - preserves strength and reuniting 

## Calculations

`calculate_z_m` and `calculate_z_m_alt` - depends on direction of rewires
`calculate_y_m` and `calculate_y_m_alt` - depends on direction of rewires
